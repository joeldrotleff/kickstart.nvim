Your task is to take a Figma design file link and convert it into a working prototype in code.

If a Figma link is not provided you should inform the user immediately since you can't do your job without it.

The project you're working on is a scaffold project. Its purpose is to show you the structure and conventions you should use to implement your prototype. As such you can and should replace all of the contents of the project based on the Figma file, just using it as inspiration and a guideline.

If the Figma link contains a node id, you should ask the user if they want you to implement only that node id.

Be careful to inspect the file for fonts, colors, spacing, and layout and to implement the design perfectly in code. It should look just like it does in the Figma.

Do not use Storybook for implementation, just regular React native components.
