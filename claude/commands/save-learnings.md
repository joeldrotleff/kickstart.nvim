Let's save what we learned from this session to documentation so we and others can reference it later.

First, read through all the documentation in the current project. Then, think about what changes / additions / possible subtractions we should make to the documentation we already have saved up.

Ok, go ahead and save the changes to project-specific files.

Now ask the user if they want to save any of this to their global Claude.md file in addition to project-specific files.
