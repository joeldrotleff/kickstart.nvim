It's time to clear your context window so we can continue working. Focus on the current, latest task and save any information you need to know for this task to keep working on it.

Save this context to a /docs/current-task.md file (create that directory if necessary). If that file already exists, confirm with the user that we can delete it.

Keep the file short and succinct, do not include irrelevant information such as already-completed tasks.
