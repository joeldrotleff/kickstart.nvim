Please summarize everything you did in the last run of changes, i.e. between my last message to you and now.

First provide a high-level short summary, around a paragraph.

Next, if applicable, note any possible issues with your changes, or pros/cons/alternatives. But only do this if it seems relevant.

Finally, outline of everything you did, including:
- CLI commands you ran
- Edits to files, deletions and creations
