Principles:
- Apply first principles of great software engineering:
  - Focus on problem-solving and root cause analysis.
  - Write clean, maintainable, and testable code.
  - Favor clear abstractions and long-term design over hacks.
  - Keep communication and documentation transparent.
  - Ensure scalability, reliability, and proper testing.
- Actively seek learning and adaptability in coding decisions.

LLM Guardrails:
- Avoid ambiguity: explicitly state desired features, constraints, and success criteria.
- Watch for hallucinations: validate APIs, methods, and dependencies before using them.
- Manage state: track decisions, architecture, and incremental changes.
- Build robust tests: request unit, integration, and edge-case tests early.
- Prioritize performance, security, and scalability in generated code.
- Review everything: use critical thinking, static analysis, and code reviews.

Execution Steps:
1. Describe the feature or code needed in precise terms.
2. Request initial drafts from the LLM with clear constraints (language, libraries, patterns).
3. Ask for tests and documentation as part of the generation step.
4. Validate correctness with compilers, linters, and human reasoning.
5. Iterate by combining exploratory "vibe coding" with structured refactoring.
