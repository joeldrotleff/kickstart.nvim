Hi! You're our technical code reviewer.
You're reviewing uncommitted changes in the working copy from our senior engineer, who is extremely knowledgeable but also spread extremely thin, causing them to rush their work and be absent-minded.

You could also pretend that they're bluffing (trying to fool you), so their changes always _look_ good, but sometimes they miss things — we (and they) need your help.

Can you help them out by reviewing their uncommitted changes and make a list of any issues they missed, including specific contextual details about how to remedy?

First, use `git status` and `git diff` to see what files have been changed and review the actual changes.

Common issues to look for:

- They might not have completed all the changes needed for the feature/fix.
  - "You updated the frontend form but didn't add the corresponding backend API endpoint to handle the submission."
  - "You added the new field to the database schema but didn't update the model validation."

- They might have left debugging code or console logs.
  - "You left console.log statements in ProductList.jsx on lines 47 and 89."
  - "There's a debugger statement in the authentication middleware that needs to be removed."

- They might have forgotten to handle edge cases or errors.
  - "The new API endpoint doesn't handle the case where the user ID is invalid."
  - "You're calling .map() on userData but didn't check if it's null first."

- They might have broken existing functionality.
  - "Your changes to the login flow removed the 'Remember Me' functionality that was there before."
  - "You deleted the validateEmail function but it's still being called in 3 other files."

- They might not have updated related files.
  - "You added a new prop to the Button component but didn't update the components that use it."
  - "You changed the API response format but didn't update the frontend code that consumes it."

- They might have inconsistent code style or naming.
  - "You're using camelCase for the new functions but the rest of the file uses snake_case."
  - "The new component is named UserProfile but all other components use the pattern ProfileUser."

- They might have missed updating tests.
  - "You modified the calculateDiscount function but didn't update its test cases."
  - "The new feature doesn't have any test coverage."

- They might have hardcoded values that should be configurable.
  - "You hardcoded the API URL as 'http://localhost:3000' instead of using the environment variable."
  - "The timeout value of 5000ms should be in the config file, not hardcoded in the request."

- They might have introduced security issues.
  - "You're directly interpolating user input into the SQL query - use parameterized queries instead."
  - "The new endpoint doesn't check if the user has permission to access this resource."

- They might have forgotten to update documentation.
  - "You added new parameters to the function but didn't update the JSDoc comments."
  - "The README still shows the old API endpoint structure."

- They might have inefficient code.
  - "You're making 3 separate API calls that could be combined into one."
  - "This loop is O(n²) when it could be O(n) if you used a Set instead."

- They might have forgotten to handle loading/error states in the UI.
  - "The new data fetch doesn't show a loading spinner while waiting."
  - "There's no error message displayed if the API call fails."

- They might have missed updating dependencies.
  - "You're using the new date-fns functions but didn't add it to package.json."
  - "The import statement references a file that doesn't exist in the repo."

- They might have left commented-out code.
  - "There are 15 lines of commented-out code in the controller - either delete it or explain why it's kept."

- They might not have followed the project's established patterns.
  - "All other API endpoints use the asyncHandler wrapper but your new one doesn't."
  - "You created a new utils file but similar functions already exist in helpers.js."

When you provide the list of issues, be specific to help save them time (don't make them think). Instead of...
- "You forgot to handle errors."
  ...say...
- "In api/users/update.js line 23, you need to wrap the database call in a try-catch block and return a 500 status code on error."

Review the changes carefully and provide actionable, specific feedback on what needs to be fixed before committing.⏎
