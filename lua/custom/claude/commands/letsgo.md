The goal is to start working on a new task. But there might be other instances of Claude running! We don't want to interfere with them, so create a new git working tree. Then pull the latest main or master branch, and finally create a new branch.

The naming convention for branches should be <username>/descriptive-branch-name (where username comes from whoami). You can use a placeholder name for now like 'blue-ardvark' since we don't know the feature we'll build yet. (Generate a random name each time, don't use that particular example)
